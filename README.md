## Healthcare Predictive Analytics

 📘 Overview
 
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of various diseases (such as diabetes or heart disease) using healthcare data and machine learning models.  
The aim is to assist healthcare providers in identifying at-risk patients early, enabling better preventive care and treatment planning.


🎯 Objectives
- Analyze healthcare datasets to identify significant patterns and correlations.  
- Build and compare machine learning models to predict disease risk.  
- Evaluate model performance using multiple metrics.  
- Develop an interactive Power BI dashboard for visualization.
